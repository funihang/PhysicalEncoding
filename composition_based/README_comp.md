`data_preprocessing.ipynb` is used to preprocess original datasets from `MatBench` and `Matminer`. And then we can get the composition datasets with compositions, property values, and corresponding `Magpie` features.
`element_removal.ipynb` is the element removal OOD selection method. This file contains both ER1 and ER2 selection methods.
`property_selection.ipynb` is the property value OOD selection method. 
`clustering.ipynb` is the clustering OOD selection method. We use this selection method in the Discussion section in our paper.
